## 🧠 Project Description

**S.U.T.R.A.** is an open-source initiative that breaks down complex Large Language Model (LLM) research papers into simple, structured, and easy-to-understand insights. Drawing inspiration from Indian knowledge systems and powered by technical clarity, this repository serves both as a personal research archive and a public guide for AI learners worldwide.

Whether you're a student, researcher, or developer — this project helps you **decode architectures, training methods, alignment strategies, and benchmarks** used in today’s most advanced LLMs.

## ✨ Why "S.U.T.R.A."?

> **S.U.T.R.A.** stands for  
> **Simplified Understanding of Transformer Research & Architectures**

The name is inspired by the Sanskrit word "सूत्र" meaning **a thread of knowledge or guiding principle** — just like sutras in ancient Indian texts, this repo helps you thread together difficult LLM concepts into understandable knowledge.
